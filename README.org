* Configuration
- Install Emacs.
- Make sure you have no *.emacs*. You only need an empty *.emacs.d*
  directory, or simply install Emacs, delete *.emacs.d* and *.emacs*
  (in case you have it) and clone this repository.
- Open Emacs.
- Open *~/.emacs.d/init.org*
- Use the command: ~C-c C-v t~ (or ~M-x org-babel-tangle RET~)
- Restart Emacs and wait until it installs everything
- OPTIONAL: ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts RET~ if you want to use ~NeoTree~
- DONE!
